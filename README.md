# Profit Margin Calculator for Mercado Livre E-commerce

![alt screenshot of the program](/resources/img/screenshot.jpg "Program screenshot")

## What is it?
This project is my first try at using React.js! It is a program that calculates the `profit margin` of a certain product sold in Mercado Livre, the `biggest marketplace in Brazil`.

## How it works?
The program receives `five params` and returns an info table with all the `detailed costs and expenses` involved in selling a product in Mercado Livre.

>**The params received are:**

- Type of ad (classic or premium)
- Selling price
- Product cost
- Selling tax
- Product weight



>**The outputs are:**

- Selling price
- Sale tax (in BRL)
- Commission from the marketplace
- Freight (based on weight)
- Product cost
- Net Profit
- Percentage of profit over sale's price
- Percentage of profit over the cost

## Project Goal
I build this to `study React.js in its legacy form`, using classes instead of functions. **I have never touched React before this projec**t, so it was a way to solidify what I was learning in Codecademy's full-stack engineer course.

This will also be `used by e-commerce companies` to calculate profit and product viability `faster and more conveniently` than a normal excel spreadsheet.

I also plan on adapting this project to React Native to `make it an app`.

## Technologies used:

### React.js

>**Main concepts:**
- Class-based React.js
- Props and states manipulations
- Separation of responsibilities between components

### CSS
For making the style of each component and overall app.
